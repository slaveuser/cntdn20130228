This project includes the following programs:

numbers - command-line solver for the numbers game
letters - command-line solver for the letters game
gletters - python gtk solver for the letters game
tkletters - perl tk solver for the letters game

There is also the game/ directory which contains a very silly and unfinished
simulator for the countdown game.

Build and install the solvers with:
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
# make install

Build and install the game simulator with:
$ mkdir game/build && cd game/build
$ cmake .. && make
# make install

The dictionary is 2of4brif.txt from 12dicts revision 5.
